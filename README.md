# soberano_natalie_homework1
My name is Natalie Soberano and I am a second-year student at Western University in the Media, Theory and Production program in the faculty of Information and Media studies that is combined with Fanshawe College.
This website that I am creating will give you a sense of who I am and essentially the things I like to do and the people I love.
